 * Google AdSense loader — see docs/plan/03-adsense.md STEP 1.
 *
 * Mounted ONLY on the public surface (`PublicShell`), never on the authenticated
 * `AppShell`, so a couple's private screens (records / compose / profile) never
 * load an ad script — the standing principle in 03-adsense.md ("광고는 공개
 * 콘텐츠에만"). Anonymous crawlers/visitors always hit the PublicShell rendering
 * of public pages, so this is enough for AdSense site review/verification.
 *
 * Reads the publisher id from `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT` and renders nothing
 * when unset — graceful off in local/dev and anywhere the env isn't provided.
 *
 * This only LOADS AdSense (required for verification/review). It does NOT place
 * any ad units — the `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` AdUnit component and its
 * placement on public pages are STEP 1 items 3–4 and are still TODO (need slot
 * ids issued after approval). Consent Mode v2 defaults (item 5) are shipped —
 * see `ConsentDefaultScript` below and `ConsentBanner` (components/molecules).
